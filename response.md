# Digital Death | Response
In the simulation "Digital Death," a tree is procedurally formed and then falls apart from the bottom up. I think it was made by programming the tree in its different growth stages and then blending them together with a fade effect (similar to a transition you would see in PowerPoint or iMovie). Claudia Hart likely used variables to copy the pink leaves in different areas in the simulation. This simulation doesn't mean a lot to me because I think any symbolism that was present may have flew over my head, but I admit that the tree (and its growth and decay) was a joy to look at.
