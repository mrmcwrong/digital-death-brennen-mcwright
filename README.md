# Digital Death
Discussion of Claudia Hart's <em>Digital Death</em>

## Instructions

1. Watch the video [at this link](https://vimeo.com/93401443), and jot down some notes on what you are seeing. What is on the screen? How do you think it was made? What does it mean to you?
2. Click <b>response.md</b> in this repo click the pencil on the top right to edit the file. 
3. Referencing your notes from step 1, write a description of your experience of the video in paragraph format to <b>response.md</b>. Be sure to answer <b>all three questions</b> from Part 1 in order to get credit for this response. Write at least 100 words.  

GatorGrade will check your response for word count and formatting, but your grade won't be final until the professor reads and evaluates what you've written. 
Make sure that you are formatting your response as a [paragraph](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#paragraphs) and not a [heading](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings) -- GatorGrade will not include headings in its word count. 

### To summarize, successful responses will: 

- Exist inside response.md
- Answer three questions: 
    - What is on the screen? 
    - How do you think it was made? 
    - What does it mean to you?
- Contain at least 100 words in paragraph (not header) format
